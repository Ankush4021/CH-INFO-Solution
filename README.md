## CH Info Solution - IT Services Website

This is a modern, responsive single-page website for **CH Info Solution**, built with **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**.

### Tech Stack

- React (functional components)
- Vite bundler
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

### Structure

- `src/App.jsx` – Top-level layout (Hero, Services, About, Contact, Footer)
- `src/components/*` – Reusable, semantic UI components
- `tailwind.config.js` & `postcss.config.js` – Tailwind and PostCSS configuration

All sections are mobile-first, use semantic HTML, and follow a consistent dark tech theme using `slate` and `blue` tones.
